# ITSC-1212-Project
In this project, I analyzed Coromon character data from a CSV file using Python. I organized the data, displayed the total number of Coromon, and calculated average stats like Health, Attack, Defense, and Speed for each type. I identified the types with the highest and lowest averages, applying data structures and statistical analysis.
